***Notes***
Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of Computer Science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image.

* Computer Vision is a Challenging!
* Why is it so hard? So Many Reasons!
  * Camera sensor & lens limitations
  * Viewpoint variations
  * Changing Lighting
  * Scaling
  * Non-rigid deformations
  * Occlusion
  * Clutter
  * Object class variations
  * Ambiguous Images/Optical Illusions
  
* Despite the difficulty, Computer Vision scientists have had many success stories!
  * Robotic Navigation â€“ Self Driving Cars
  * Face Detection & Recognition
  * Search Engine Image Search
  * License Plate Reading
  * Snapchat & Instagram Face Filters
  * Object Recognition
  * And Many more

***So why OpenCV in Python?***
  * Python is one of the easiest languages for beginners.
  * It is extremely powerful for data science and machine learning applications.
  * It stores images in numpy arrays which allows us to do some very powerful operations quite easily.
